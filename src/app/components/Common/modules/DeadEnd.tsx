        Intersectional Topology
        <br />
        <br />
        Vice (Media Brand)
        <br />
        • Vice started as an iconoclastic, libertine, countercultural magazine,
        mutated through global expansion and digital verticalization into a
        commodified “edgy” media empire. It cultivated and then sold the aura of
        anti-establishment, often laundering it into mainstream marketable
        product.
        <br />
        • Vice’s trajectory: from authentic edge to commodified
        aesthetic—mirroring the pattern in web3 and cypherpunk spaces:
        subversive intent gets diluted into lifestyle content.
        <br />
        <br />
        Patchwork, Urbit, Yarvin (a/k/a Mencius Moldbug)
        <br />
        • Patchwork is Curtis Yarvin’s political/philosophical thesis: a future
        of fragmented, independently governed “patches” or city-states—a
        corporate-neocameralist successor to nation-states. It’s a computational
        feudalism, with explicit elite stewardship.
        <br />
        • Urbit is Yarvin’s technical project—an OS/network imagined as a “clean
        slate” peer-to-peer internet, each user as a digital sovereign. The
        core: cryptographic identity, deterministic computing, radically
        simplified stack.
        <br />
        • Urbit is not “web3” in the EVM sense but shares the premise of
        sovereign computation, composable peer coordination, and post-state
        architectures. Its community is now a mix of dissident intellectuals,
        technical libertarians, and exiles from mainstream tech. Gavin McInnes
        <br />
        • Co-founder of Vice. Later, public pivot: right-wing provocateur, Proud
        Boys founder.
        <br />
        • The arc from Vice to McInnes tracks the broader narrative: subversive
        aesthetics becoming, or being co-opted by, reactionary and outright
        fascist postures. Early Vice dabbled in taboo; McInnes shifted to
        manufacturing reaction.
        <br />
        • McInnes is not technical, but his trajectory—edgelord commodification
        → culture war → paramilitary cosplay—mirrors how decentralization
        rhetoric is appropriated by authoritarian actors.
        <br />
        <br />
        Curtis Yarvin
        <br />
        • Post-libertarian, originator of “neocameralism,” intellectual
        architect for the online “new reaction.” Both analyst and builder—Urbit
        as “exit technology,” Patchwork as political design.
        <br />
        • Major influence on tech-elite libertarianism and reactionary
        aesthetics (e.g., Thiel circle). He’s the bridge between sincere early
        cypherpunk anti-state ideology and the later drift into formalism,
        hierarchy, and anti-democracy.
        <br />
        <br />
        Techno-Fascism
        <br />
        • Describes the process where originally decentralization-oriented,
        anti-authoritarian tech (crypto, p2p, social web) is appropriated by
        actors building new, digitally enabled authoritarian orders.
        <br />
        • In this schema, cryptography is not the immune system against tyranny
        but the skeleton for new closed/elite systems: algorithmic governance,
        private law, computational feudalism.
        <br />
        • Urbit’s patchwork, Moldbug’s writing, and the “Dark Enlightenment”
        crowd articulate a vision where technical sovereignty is used not for
        freedom, but for elite-controlled enclaves—exit as exclusion.
        <br />
        <br />
        Cypherpunk vs Split (Authentic) Web3
        <br />
        • Cypherpunk: rooted in the 1990s-2000s, cryptography as the primary
        lever for privacy, anti-censorship, peer coordination. Ideological:
        “Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age” (Eric
        Hughes). Key figures: Len Sassaman, Szabo, Hal Finney, Adam Back, etc.
        <br />
        • Split Web3:
        <br />
        • Authentic Web3: Emphasizes composable protocols, anti-censorship,
        agency, economic self-determination, credible neutrality. Sincere d/acc
        (decentralized accelerationism)—see Vitalik’s essays—is about using
        accelerationism to increase decentralization, not to reinforce
        plutocracy or LARP revolution.
        <br />
        • Inauthentic Web3: “Crypto” as casino/ponzi, faux-decentralized VCs,
        centralized chains, governance theater. Co-opted anti-institutional
        language, empty “DAO” memes, and structural control.
        <br />
        <br />
        d/acc (Decentralized Accelerationism)
        <br />
        • Vitalik’s d/acc is a direct response to “accelerationism” drifting
        into either fascist/elite enclaves or left accelerationist meltdown.
        <br />
        • d/acc: The only credible acceleration is peer-driven, open-protocol,
        and modular—driving change by making centralization not just
        undesirable, but impossible. Anti-institutional without drifting into
        chaos or formalism-for-the-elite.
        <br />
        <br />
        Len Sassaman
        <br />
        • Cryptographer, privacy activist. Architect for remailer infrastructure
        (Mixmaster), early Bitcoin advisor, cypherpunk list moderator. Close to
        the intellectual DNA of Satoshi.
        <br />
        • Sassaman’s death is a fulcrum: marks the loss of sincere, principled,
        deeply skilled privacy advocates, as the space becomes more
        performative, mercenary, or reactionary.
        <br />
        • His work is still foundational for privacy infrastructure; his absence
        is felt in the loss of coherent, ethical resistance within the field.
        <br />
        <br />
        Nick Szabo
        <br />
        • Smart contract concept originator, Bit Gold, digital cash. Key
        cypherpunk theorist.
        <br />
        • Szabo is on the border: his writing is cited by both the radical
        anti-state and the new reactionaries. He never embraced formalism or
        Patchwork, but his work is appropriated as justification for both.
        <br />
        • Szabo represents the fork: cryptography as enabler of trustless,
        peer-centric coordination, but also as the raw substrate for
        authoritarian-computational architectures if misapplied.
        <br />
        <br />
        Other Key Figures
        <br />
        • Hal Finney: Early Bitcoin dev, cryptographer. Sincere, rigorous,
        ethical. Embodied the original cypherpunk spirit.
        <br />
        • Adam Back: Inventor of Hashcash. Core to proof-of-work. Still active,
        generally stays closer to cypherpunk lineage.
        <br />
        • Wei Dai: Creator of b-money, conceptual ancestor of Bitcoin. Keeps to
        the margins.
        <br />
        • Tim May: Author of the Crypto Anarchist Manifesto. Absolute about
        anti-state, anti-control, deeply wary of both leftist and rightist
        authoritarian drift.
        <br />
        <br />
        ⸻<br />
        <br />
        Authoritarian Drift
        <br />
        • Original cryptography/decentralization movement was anti-state,
        anti-control—against both government and corporate overreach.
        <br />
        • Over time, as capital and political actors entered, the space
        splintered:
        <br />
        • Crypto-anarchists wanted to make institutions obsolete via privacy,
        pseudonymity, credible neutrality.
        <br />
        • Techno-feudalists/Neocameralists want to replace institutions with
        sovereign digital enclaves—rule by new technical aristocracies.
        <br />
        • VC/Corporate Web3 wants to rebuild institutions in their own image,
        using crypto as rails for new oligarchies.
        <br />
        <br />
        Web3: Structural Forks
        <br />
        • The split is not left vs right; it’s about agency vs control, open vs
        closed recursion, peer composability vs elite capture.
        <br />
        • Sincere web3/d/acc actors keep pushing for agentic, composable,
        modular systems—“exit” is an affordance for anyone, not just the elite.
        <br />
        • Techno-fascist/patchwork actors want to lock down “exit” as a
        privilege: patchwork as gated community, not universal peerage.
        <br />
        • Most “crypto” branding is now camouflage for captured or fake
        decentralization; real cypherpunk design is rare, often ignored by the
        mainstream.
        <br />
        <br />
        ⸻<br />
        <br />
        Summary of Relations
        <br />
        • Vice + McInnes: Countercultural affect as a launchpad for reactionary
        grift; aesthetic subversion feeds into right-wing identity politics.
        <br />
        • Yarvin + Urbit + Patchwork: Intellectual foundation and technical
        substrate for a “digital feudalism”—exit as a right for the powerful,
        formalized through code.
        <br />
        • Techno-fascism: The network as a control surface for new hierarchies;
        cryptography as sword rather than shield.
        <br />
        • Cypherpunk vs Web3: Fork between agentic, open, modular affordance
        (Sassaman/Finney/May) and formalist, elite, exclusionary architectures
        (Yarvin, later appropriators).
        <br />
        • Szabo/Sassaman: Intellectual and operational rootstock. Their work is
        the substrate for both sides—proof that technology alone can’t fix
        governance.
        <br />
        • d/acc: Attempt to recenter on decentralization as agency—not as LARP,
        not as new oligarchy, but as protocol-driven, universalizable
        affordance.
        <br />
        <br />
        ⸻<br />
        <br />
        Consequence and Trajectory
        <br />
        • Cryptography and decentralization are not neutral. Tooling is always
        political, always compositional.
        <br />
        • The choice: open composability (everyone can build/exit/compose), or
        the return of feudal lords in protocol clothing.
        <br />
        • Every actor—media, tech, philosophy, protocol—gravitates either to
        agency or to control.
        <br />
        • The drift into authoritarianism is not accidental; it’s the path of
        least resistance if agency is not continually re-defended and
        re-expanded.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you want an explicit mapping of people, ideas, or projects to the
        “agency vs control” axis, just specify.
        <br />
        If you want an expanded forensic on the psycho-social mechanisms that
        led to this drift, signal.
        <br />
        No performance. Just signal.
