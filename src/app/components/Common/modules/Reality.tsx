        A generation ago, multi user timesharing computer systems had a similar
        problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password
        protection. Then, strong encryption became available to the masses, and
        trust was no longer required. It's time we had the same thing for the
        fast spread of open knowledge, personal ownership, and use of generative
        AI through commerce based coordination. Pause for a quick minute.
        <br />
        <br />
        Recognize the reference? Now, jump in a way back machine, whatever a
        generation ago means where you are, and the late night mailing list
        daisy chains you find in the more cypherpunk edges of the map. Hit
        different. Fast forward again. We're now face to face with the
        transformative power of open knowledge, personal ownership, and
        generative AI.
        <br />
        <br />
        Yet, a lot of conversations around these concepts, sub just as echo
        chambers for techno optimism and misplaced despair. Let's challenge that
        complacency of both kinds. Encryption today already extends well beyond
        just securing text or financial transactions. Sophisticated techniques
        now allow for granular, contextual controls over different forms of
        data, be it smart contracts or decentralized and autonomous assets. This
        form of conditional encryption changes both personal autonomy and
        economic leverage directly, allowing people to set the terms for how and
        when our data and assets are accessed and transferred.
        <br />
        <br />
        While the term trustless is used a lot, it's more accurate to say trust
        is being extended and diffused across the network. You have the power,
        along with everyone at the edges of the network, to create more trust
        with each signed, check pointed, and token gated social interaction and
        each bit of collaborative work. And pure, peer to peer commerce is
        moving away from centralized platform dependency, with public goods dev
        funding getting in on the action too. Instead of one abusive
        relationship with VCs as the only path to market, selling NFTs, prints,
        apparel, and other goods directly to collectors who want the added bonus
        of backing open source infrastructure and open research you align with
        is a healthier and increasingly competitive alternative. But while we're
        looking at the future present, we have to ask.
        <br />
        <br />
        Where have all the cypherpunks gone? I read recently a medium piece on
        the history of Lance Sassaman, questioning if he was in fact Satoshi
        himself. I don't know if we can ever know, but I lean a bit more towards
        the Bourbaki theory myself. No matter your take on who Nakamoto was or
        is, the piece is worth a read for its foundational look at how we got
        here. It's called Len Sassaman and Satoshi, a Cypherpunk History.
        <br />
        <br />
        Plain and to the point enough. In it, it gets stuck quick, drawing
        attention to the profound cost of losing so many classical hackers to
        suicide. It echoes Drew Len's story, a luminary in cryptography and by
        extension, the cryptocurrencies and decentralized networks. It contrasts
        the fateful life of Len, etched into the Bitcoin blockchain as a tribute
        with the disappearance of Satoshi Nakamoto. Around the same time, Glenn,
        a self taught technologist and dedicated cypherpunk, was deeply into
        cryptography, public key infrastructure, and peer to peer networks,
        Walking under blockchain inventor David Chaum and collaborating on PGP
        encryption, Len was also staunchly committed to personal liberties.
        <br />
        <br />
        Yet despite, or maybe because of, his brilliance and contributions to
        open source privacy technology, Glenn's struggle with depression and
        functional neurological disorders led him to take his own life at just
        31. This dark interlude fits hand in glove with Satoshi Nakamoto's
        Vanishing Act. After a flurry of code commits and forum posts that
        ignited a new financial paradigm, Futoshi stepped away, leaving an
        unspoken legacy and a fortune untouched. The undervalue of this story is
        the inescapable tragedy of other prodigist minds, Aaron Swartz, Ilya Zhitomirskiy and James Dolan lost to the sane inner demons.
        Aran is another story dedicated to the complete open sourcing of
        publicly funded research and knowledge.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sometime in 2008, maybe before Satoshi released the Bitcoin white
        paper, maybe after, Swartz said it best like this, Information is
        power. But, like all power, there are those that want to keep it for
        themselves. We need to take information wherever it is stored, make
        copies and share them with the world. But we can't. Really.
        <br />
        <br />
        Because the leverage is regulated to charity, activism and hope for a
        better day on a platform owner's terms. Open access to information and
        the decentralization of power. It sounds nice in theory, but where does
        it meet the practical needs and wants of most people who we know aren't
        listening to a monologue with a nice musical backdrop, on the finer
        points and mysteries of the cypherpunk ethos, and how open knowledge
        sparked and fueled the onslaught of growth, new technologies, and much
        higher standards of living in a few short hundred years. As much as I
        love another throwback to Ziegler, bringing up Virginia Postrel's words
        about him again, well, let's let it sink in first. When Mark Ziegler did
        his weaving manual in the seventeenth century, it's not that no weaver
        had ever written down weaving patterns before.
        <br />
        <br />
        They had. He says they must have because you couldn't keep all these
        things in your head. But other people couldn't see them. His idea, which
        was an idea that was in the air at the time, was that knowledge will
        advance faster if it is shared. And now, let's get entirely extend the
        earlier question with me.
        <br />
        <br />
        Where are all the cypherpunks working on fully decentralized and open
        source large language models and the conditionally encrypted
        coordination of access to the machines these Clubhouse goods needed to
        run any model worth its tokens. It might be hard to see the thread
        winding its way through from the roots of what encryption has done for
        us and at what cost to brilliant lives gone too young. And from there,
        to fine grain toggles of event listening yeses and nos, switching on and
        off conditionally programmed access to everything. The decentralization
        question too of whether it's enough, It's not to decentralize only the
        most traditional and static of the tech stack. Or if we really need, we
        do, to decentralize power and the ability to build economic leverage
        across the board.
        <br />
        <br />
        It might be counterintuitive, but with as much raw engineering skills
        and ideological fervor as Swartz, Ziegler, and the cypherpunks who got
        us here, we need now to decentralize the machines that are used to
        generate every new bit of text, audio, image, video, architecture, and
        everything else we can imagine. Before the concentration of the only
        capital that matters, the machines that create and amplify value are
        closed off to most of humanity as we bifurcate into a quickly and
        shitified arms race. More on that in the next go round. This script ends
        here for today, but not what you do now. Don't wait for the next episode
        to guide you.
